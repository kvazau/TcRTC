# TcRTC
Python 3 module to interface with Tinychat's WebRTC client. 

Requirements!
Python 3
Python 3 module "websocket-client"
(https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client) [pip install websocket-client] 

Notes!
As of now, this is just a prof of concept. The socket connection WILL die as TcRTC does not yet respond to the server's PING messages.
