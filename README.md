# TcRTC
Python 3 module to interface with Tinychat's WebRTC client. 

### Requirements:
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [websocket-client library (`pip3 install websocket-client`)](
    https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client
    )

### Notes:
As of now, this is just a proof of concept. The socket connection WILL die as
TcRTC does not yet respond to the server's PING messages.
